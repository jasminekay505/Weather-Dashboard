# Weather-Dashboard

This application uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve current and forecasted weather data for different cities. 

To view weather data, simply type in the city you wish to search for into the input form, then click the search button. When the search button is clicked, the city is added to the search history for an easy way to view again. The current weather is displayed along with a five day forecast.
